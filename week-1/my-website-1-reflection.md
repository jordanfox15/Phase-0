Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to our local computer to a non-technical person.

	-Login to your Github account and use the plus sign in the upper right corner and choose the option to create a new repository.  Here you will name your repository, choose your options and hit create repository.  Then copy the URL in the text box on the right where it says clone URL, then go to your command line and type "git clone " and then paste in the URL after and hit enter.

Describe what open source means.

	-Open source means that anyone using a program has access to the code of that program meaning that anyone can alter/re-write that program instead of just being able to run it on their computer.

What do you think about Open Source?  Does it make you nervous or protective?  Does it feel like utopia?

	-I think open source is rather amazing.  It allows coders from all over the world to work on the same project without ever even contacting one another.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

	-I would say it is very important if for now other reason than that it would seem that without them someone could take the code you have written and claim it was completely written by them without changing a thing.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge?  Did you have any "aha" moments?  What did you struggle with?

	-I recieved a better understanding of how a website can be hosted through GitHub.  The thing I am still struggling with is branches.  The concepts in this challenge were easy to understand.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic?  If so, please list it.
