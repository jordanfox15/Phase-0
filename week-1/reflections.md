# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

So after looking at a few of the research options I chose "the zone" to look into more.  I played sports all through high school so I was already familiar with the concept in terms of physical activity but not in regards to work.  Most information around this topic is organized around tips, tricks and lists on how to achieve this state.  They all state that the work you are doing should be challenging and interesting.  So it would seem I am on the right track with DBC.  However this topic is about getting the most out of the time you spend working and not managing that time.  My time management strategy is simple and effective, at least for me.  Most days of the week I will do several hours of work straight after eating breakfast.  This is how I have always dealt with work that must be self-motivated including the prerequisite work for the interview for this course.  This strategy works well for me and I am going to be very successful with the Phase 0 course.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

A shell is an environment with no graphical interface and all commands must be entered on the command line.  Bash is simply a Linux shell.  The most challenging part of this assignment for me was resisting the urge to look at my GUI to find things or do commands.  Using the GUI is almost instinct for me after so many years and I am looking forward to feeling that way about the command line.  Yes, I was able to successfully use all of the commands from the assignment on the command line.  In my opinion the most important commands to know are pwd, ls, and cd.  If you don't know where you are or how to move around I don't know how you would get anything done.
pwd - prints out the current directory you are in
ls - lists most files and directories that exist inside current directory
mv - moves or changes the name of a file or directory
cd - changes to the directory you specify
../ - used with cd will move you up a directory
touch - creates a new, empty file
mkdir - creates a new dir
less - lets you scroll through the contents of a file
rmdir - deletes a directory
rm - deletes a file
help - prints out a list of commands for the shell

### 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

Login to your Github account and use the plus sign in the upper right corner and choose the option to create a new repository.  Here you will name your repository, choose your options and hit create repository.  To fork a repo, navigate to it's page and use the Fork button on that page and then choose which account to fork it to.  To clone a repo, copy the URL in the text box on the right where it says clone URL, then go to your command line and type "git clone " and then paste in the URL after and hit enter.  Forking a repository creates a copy of an already existing repository so that one can edit it without altering the original.  One is doing work on an existing project.  When you create a repository you are starting fresh on a new project.  Honestly I didn't have any problems with this assignment.  The directions were clear and the actions easy.  The biggest problem I had was practicing cloning and then removing repositories I couldn't remember how to remove a directory that wasn't empty so I went back to a previous assignment and found out.
