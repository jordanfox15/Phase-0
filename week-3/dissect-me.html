			Version control is a very important aspect of coding.  Without it, it would be possible to ruin weeks, months or even years of work with one accidental key-stroke.  However with version control, and the liberal use of it, a coder will always have a recent, working version of their program that they can go back to if the changes that were made were undesirable.  This isn't the only benefit of version control.  Another example might be experimenting with different ways to implement the same functionality.  You could have three different versions of a program that do the same thing and keep the one that works the best.  These aren't the only uses of version control.  Pretty much anything you can think of that involves having a previously saved copy of a project is what version control is all about.

			One tool used for version control is git.  Using the "git commit" command saves a version of your code with the changes you have just made.  Inside git, every commit, or version of your code, is saved and available to review and/or jump back to that version of the code.  This along with the description you should give every commit, allows a coder to keep track of changes made to the code.  If you do this often, over time you will have many different versions of your code that you can jump back to, as well as a detailed list of all the changes you have made.  Combine this with git's ability to make changes in a new branch, or copy of existing files and directories, and keep those changes separate from the master file until you decide to merge the changes makes git a powerful tool for coding.

<!--
	What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often?  Why?
	-I used article for this exercise as it asked me to add some body and I added a couple paragraphs of text.  But I use header, footer, and aside rather often because I seem to always have part of a webpage that belongs in these tags.
	How do elements get laid out on a page?  What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
	-Elements are laid out according to the tags they are under.  First the browser displays the html tag, then the head tag because it is inside the html tag, and so forth.
	What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge?  Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?  What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
	-I learned about snippets in this challenge.  Yes, I do think I will make more snippets.  As I develop more and more, I'm sure I will have blocks of code that I use over and over again so I will make snippets of them for ease of use.
