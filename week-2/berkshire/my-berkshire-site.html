<!--
	What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	-It was pretty cool to see we were able do it pretty easily.
	How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	-It was again not that hard.
	How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)?
	-I think we did pretty well.
	What seems good and bad about HTML?
	-It is good that the commands are pretty easy to remember however it is bad that there are a ton of elements that need to go everywhere, first and last.  It gets pretty old having to insert these everywhere.
	What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	-I don't have any.  At least at this point the number of things to remember is pretty small so I am not having any problems.
