**What is your site's primary goal or purpose?  What kind of content will your site feature?**

My site's primary goal is to introduce users to me to attract potential employers.  It will feature information on who I am and what my background and experience is, as well as contain projects I have worked on in the past.

**What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?**

My target audience's interests would be having someone build a website for them or hire an employee with web design knowledge.  It would address this by advertising me as a web designer.

**What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site?**

The primary "action" the user should take would be learning about me personally and professionally.  This would include my Bio as well as looking at my previous projects.

**What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?**

The main thing someone should know about UX is that the better users feel about using you site, the more successful it is likely to be.

**What is user experience design and why is it valuable?**

User experience design is the practice of studying and designing websites around how users feel and interact with the site.  This is valuable because as I stated in the last question, the better a user feels about using your site, the more successful it is likely to be.

**Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?**

Answering all these questions.  Always answering all these questions.
