**What is a wireframe?**

A wireframe is an initial mock-up of what you want the website you are building to look like.

**What are the benefits of wireframing?**

The benefits include having a good idea of where everything should go when you actually start building the site as well as an easy mock-up you can show to others to get feedback.

**Did you enjoy wireframing your site?**

Not particularly.  These sites are something we need to build for learning purposes.  If it was my idea and something I was excited about building then it would be different.

**Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?**

I didn't really change anything once it was built.

**What questions did you ask during this challenge?  What resources did you find to help you answer them?**

The only questions I had were how to build the wireframe with the tool I was using and I used the resources on the site to answer them.

**Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?**

I enjoyed working with the second wireframe tool I tried.  It was more complex but it made certain things like lining stuff up much easier.  Answering these questions is ALWAYS tedious.
