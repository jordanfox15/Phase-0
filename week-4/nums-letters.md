####What does "puts" do?
Puts prints the output to the console on a new line.
####What is an integer?  What is a float?
In this context an integer is any number that doesn't have a decimal point and a float is any number with a decimal point.
####What is the difference between float and integer division?  How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Float division will give you the exact answer using as many numbers behind the decimal point needed.  Integer division takes any remainders and discards them and rounds down to the nearest integer for the answer.

```ruby
puts 24 * 365
puts 60 * 24 * 365 * 10
```

####How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
I'm not entirely sure what this question is asking.  Ruby handles them fine.  As long as your code is correct Ruby will do these calculations just like a calculator.
####What is the difference between integers and floats?
An integer is any number that doesn't have a decimal point and a float is any number with a decimal point.
####What is the difference between integer and float division?
Integer division will always return the answer rounded down to the nearest integer.  Float division will return the entire answer including any decimal points required.
####What are strings?  Why and when would you use them?
Strings are basically any group of digits surrounded by ''.  Most use of strings revolve around letters, words and sentences.  If you want to print a sentence to the screen you would use strings.
####What are local variables?  Why and when would you use them?
Local variables are variables you have defined yourself in your code.  You would use them if you wanted to use something more then once and you didn't want to write the entire thing out every time.
####How was this challenge?  Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
I suppose I did yes.  But overall I expected a bit more.  These challenges were very easy.
