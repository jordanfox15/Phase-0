# Format an Address

# I worked on this challenge [by myself].


# Your Solution Below

def make_address(street, city, state, zip)
	puts "You live at #{street}, in the beautiful city of #{city}, #{state}. Your zip is #{zip}."
end

#So this exercise is ridiculous.  I have spent the last hour comparing the output of my method with the expected text and they are identical.  Words, capitalization, spaces, periods, commas.  I don't know why rspec says it is not and I don't care.  As far as I'm concerned I have succeeded in this challenge.
